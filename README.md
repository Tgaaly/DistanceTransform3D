# DistanceTransform3D

Computing the distance transform of a 3D binary point cloud in Matlab.

The binary point cloud is a 3D array of binary voxels. Each voxel is 0 or 1. The distance transform is computed at the discrete voxel locations assuming that the point cloud is scaled between -1.0 and +1.0 and zero-centered.
